Before continuing if you do not know about Rubik's Cube notation, here is a brief summary:
https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/

(assuming a QWERTY style-keyboard)

For the program, all non-prime moves are initiated by hitting the key with the letter of their notation move
	Example: hitting the 'r' key will do an R on the cube

All prime moves (R', B', etc.) are initiated by hitting the key to the LEFT of its primary move key
	WITH THE EXCEPTION OF F': This would normally be D, but because that is already a primary move, F' is executed with the 'C' key
	(the bottom left of the F key)
					Examples: L' is K, U' is Y
